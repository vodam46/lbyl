a language executed on a letter by letter basis, each command is a single
letter followed by a set number of parameters
(very inspired by vim)

all results of computations go to a default stack - "

as many stacks as symbols

formatting style:
cp - command c, parameters p

stack operations:
	pft - push - copies from f to t
	Pft - pop - moves from f to t

io:
	oc - out - char c
	On - out - number n
	i - in


arithmetic operators
lisp style - first operation, then the variables
+lr - l+r
-lr - l-r
*lr - l*r
/lr - l/r

numbers - 013456789 - single digit

if
fe - if e != 0
F - endif

loop
we - while start - if e != 0
We - while end - return to matching w if e != 0

gn - goto n

q - quit

. - comment out the next letter

functions - not yet implemented
d - define
D - end definiton
r - return
c - call
